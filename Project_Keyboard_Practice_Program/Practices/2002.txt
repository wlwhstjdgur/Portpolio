i will always remember
the day you kissed my lips
light as a feather
and it went just like this
no, it is never been better
than the summer of two thousand and a two
we were only eleven
but acting like grownups
like we are in the present
drinking from plastic cups
singing love is forever and ever
well, i guess that was true
