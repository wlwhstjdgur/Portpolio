crucify my love
if my love is blind
crucify my love
if it sets me free
never know never trust, that love should see a color
crucify my love if it should be that way
swing the heartache
feel it inside out
when the wind cries
i will say goodbye
tried to learn tried to find
to reach out for eternity
where is the answer
is this forever
