i am wandering the town all light off
i do not know where i am leaving for
the muddy rain start to fall on me
and i am walking down to subway
i can not see all around me
get me out of here
talk to me if someone is in this darkness
i am out of my head
out of my mind
tell me where i am what is going on, oh please
something is hiding me off
is this the wall of my heart
i have been lost so many things i have got
for long time i have been searching for my way
